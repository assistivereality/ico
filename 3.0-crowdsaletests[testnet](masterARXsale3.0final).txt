Runs:
[1][2][3][4]
------------
[X][X][X][X]	(Crowdsale) test	1:	Verify only owner can initiate crowdsale or setup parameters.
[X][X][X][X]	(Crowdsale) test	2:	Crowdsale is properly initialized with given parameters.

[X][X][X][X]	(Crowdsale) test	16:	+10% of total generated tokens are sent to foundation post-sale when founder runs AllocateFounderTokens.
[X][X][X][X]	(Crowdsale) test	17:	Founder can execute BeneficiaryWithdraw post-sale if min-funded or higher to transfer raised Eth to multi-sig wallet.
